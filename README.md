# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI project file for a Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard. This business intelligence tool is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a bank's loan portfolio, focusing on key performance indicators, risk assessment, and customer demographics.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is an interactive tool for financial analysts, risk managers, and executives to monitor and analyze lending activities. It helps in identifying trends, assessing portfolio health, and making data-driven decisions. The report is segmented into three main pages:

* **Summary:** Provides a high-level view of the portfolio's health by categorizing loans into "Good" and "Bad" categories. It highlights the overall financial performance and risk exposure.
* **Overview:** Offers a detailed breakdown of loan applications across various dimensions, including trends over time, geographical distribution by state, and categorization by loan purpose, employment length, and home ownership.
* **Details:** Presents a granular, table-level view of individual loan accounts, allowing for in-depth analysis and record lookups.

## KPIs and Visuals Used

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The main KPIs featured on the dashboard are:
* **Total Loan Applications:** The total number of loan requests received.
* **Total Funded Amount:** The total principal amount disbursed to borrowers.
* **Total Amount Received:** The total amount collected from borrowers, including principal and interest.
* **Average Interest Rate:** The weighted average interest rate across the loan portfolio.
* **Average DTI (Debt-to-Income):** The average ratio of a borrower's total debt to their gross income.

Each KPI card also includes **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** metrics to track recent performance and growth.

### Visualizations
* **Cards:** To display the primary KPIs.
* **Donut Charts:** Used to show the proportion of Good vs. Bad loans and the distribution of loan applications by term (e.g., 36 vs. 60 months).
* **Line Chart:** To visualize the trend of loan applications over the months.
* **Filled Map:** To illustrate the geographical distribution of loan applications by state.
* **Bar Charts:** To compare loan applications across different categories like employee tenure, loan purpose, and home ownership status.
* **Matrix/Table:** To provide a detailed breakdown of loan status (e.g., Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off) and individual loan details.
* **Slicers:** Interactive filters for **Good v Bad Loan**, **Grade**, **State**, and **Purpose** to allow users to dynamically explore the data.
